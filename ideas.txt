So, I want to make a yahtzee, deckbuilding rpg.

you roll six dice (or 7 depending on your starting class)
you get 2 rerolls (or more depending on subclass, items, etc.)
you choose which die or dice to reroll
and those dice are added up along with your combos (which are weighted) to
give you energy in an energy pool (maybe make it different for each class idk)
for which you can play cards!
cards will be like classic deckbuilder things
attacks, spells, buffs, heals, traps, maybe summons later or for different subclasses
you fight against monsters and bosses and other characters like this.
